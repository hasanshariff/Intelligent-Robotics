In my project I have submitted two code files one for each algorithm. In both of the code files they follow the same general logic and both do not include any predefined code packages, however both do utilise standard Python packages such as math, random, enum, dataclasses, heapq. I have also imported numpy and cv2. As this project was done in WeBots, WeBots allows us to use the getRecognitionObject which was utilised in algorithm 2 not 1. The sensor data was drawn using nodes implemented via the scene tree in WeBots. The big two Python libraries used were numpy and openCv (cv2). The controllers for both pieces of code are predominatley custom made by myself to the best of my ability. The code has also been documented as I saw fit trying not to over comment for the simpler functions that were used and can be easily deciphered.
